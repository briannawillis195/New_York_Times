# New_York_Times
This project was created based off of a screen shot that was shared with me of an actual NYT landing page. The overall goal was to replicate the screenshot.

<b>Tech Used:</b> HTML5 and CSS3

<b>Lessons Learned</b>: Margins and Padding make such a huge difference when used correctly. They we're able to make my website look a lot cleaner and not have content squished so close together.
